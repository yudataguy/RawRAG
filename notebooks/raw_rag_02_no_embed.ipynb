    "# Raw RAG 02: You Don't Have to Embed\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the second notebook of our Raw RAG series! This time, we're going to explore an interesting twist: creating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system without using embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why No Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering, \"Aren't embeddings a crucial part of RAG?\" Well, not always! Depending on your specific use case, there are alternative techniques that can be just as effective - and sometimes even more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We'll Cover\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll dive into several non-embedding approaches for information retrieval:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **BM25**: A powerful ranking function used in document retrieval\n",
    "2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques**: Using linguistic features for matching\n",
    "3. **Reranking**: Improving initial search results for better relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods can often provide excellent results, especially for certain types of data or specific application requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: For simplicity, we'll be using Cohere's Rerank API in some examples.*\n",

    "\n",
    "BM25 (Best Matching 25) is a ranking function used in information retrieval, improving upon earlier TF-IDF methods. It's widely used in search applications due to its effectiveness and simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "BM25 calculates a relevance score for documents based on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Term Frequency**: How often query terms appear in a document.\n",
    "2. **Inverse Document Frequency**: How rare or common terms are across all documents.\n",
    "3. **Document Length**: Adjusting scores to avoid bias towards longer documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- Caps the impact of repeated terms\n",
    "- Normalizes for document length\n",
    "- Based on probabilistic retrieval framework\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages for RAG Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "- Effective: Often outperforms simpler models\n",
    "- Efficient: Low computational overhead\n",
    "- No training required: Works well without large datasets or training phases\n",
    "\n",
    "In our RAG system, BM25 offers a powerful way to retrieve relevant documents without embeddings, making it suitable for many applications.\n",

    "\n",
    "## How Reranking Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Retrieval**: A fast, broad search method (like BM25) retrieves a set of potentially relevant documents.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses more complex relevance models than initial retrieval\n",
    "- Can incorporate additional context or features not used in the first pass\n",
    "- Often leverages machine learning or deep learning techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits in RAG Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improved Accuracy**: Helps surface the most relevant documents for the given query\n",
    "- **Balances Efficiency and Effectiveness**: Combines fast initial retrieval with more nuanced ranking\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Can be tailored to specific use cases or domains\n",
    "\n",
    "By incorporating reranking, RAG systems can significantly enhance the quality of retrieved context, leading to more accurate and relevant generated responses."

    "## Efficient Keyword Extraction with spaCy\n",
    "\n",
    "While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful natural language processing capabilities, their probabilistic nature can lead to inconsistent results when extracting keywords. Enter spaCy, a lightweight and efficient NLP library that provides a more deterministic approach to keyword extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Choose spaCy?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Deterministic Results**: Unlike LLMs, spaCy's rule-based and statistical models produce consistent outputs for the same input, enhancing reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**: spaCy's smaller models are designed for speed and low resource consumption, making them ideal for production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ease of Use**: With a simple API, spaCy allows for quick implementation and straightforward integration into existing workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Customizability**: spaCy offers various pre-trained models of different sizes, allowing you to balance accuracy and performance based on your specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Debuggability**: The deterministic nature of spaCy's models makes it easier to trace and debug the keyword extraction process.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging spaCy's smaller, focused models for keyword extraction, we can achieve consistent and efficient results. This approach not only simplifies our RAG pipeline but also makes it more robust and easier to maintain in the long run.\n",

    "# Conclusion: Powerful RAG Without Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've explored three powerful techniques that enable us to build effective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems without relying on embeddings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **BM25 (Best Matching 25)**\n",
    "   - A robust ranking function for information retrieval\n",
    "   - Balances term frequency, inverse document frequency, and document length\n",
    "   - Provides efficient and interpretable search results\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reranking**\n",
    "   - Refines initial search results for improved relevance\n",
    "   - Combines fast initial retrieval with more sophisticated ranking\n",
    "   - Enhances the quality of retrieved context for RAG systems\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **NLP(Natural Language Processing) with spaCy**\n",
    "   - Offers deterministic keyword extraction and named entity recognition\n",
    "   - Provides efficient, lightweight models for various NLP tasks\n",
    "   - Enables consistent and debuggable text analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging these techniques, we've demonstrated that it's possible to create highly effective RAG systems without the need for complex embedding models. This approach offers several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: These methods often require less computational resources than embedding-based approaches.\n",
    "- **Interpretability**: The logic behind BM25 and rule-based NLP is easier to understand and debug.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Each component can be fine-tuned or replaced to suit specific use cases.\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Deterministic results from spaCy provide reproducible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you continue to develop RAG systems, consider how these techniques can be combined or adapted to meet your specific needs. Remember, the best approach often depends on your particular use case, data, and performance requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next steps for exploration:\n",
    "- Experiment with different BM25 parameters\n",
    "- Implement custom reranking algorithms\n",
    "- Explore advanced spaCy pipelines for more complex NLP tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "By mastering these techniques, you're well-equipped to build sophisticated RAG systems that are both powerful and efficient. Keep experimenting and refining your approach!"
